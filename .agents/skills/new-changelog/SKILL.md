description: Create stable desktop changelogs under packages/changelog/content, grounded in changes since the previous stable release and gated on actual publication.
metadata:
  internal: true

## Channel contract

Nightly publication is retired. Prepare stable notes in
`packages/changelog/content/<version>.md`, covering all desktop user-facing
changes since the previous stable, including changes once described in Nightly
notes. Preserve historical Nightly notes; do not generate or announce new Nightly
releases.

Only released stable entries appear on the website. Deployable builds include a
versioned file only when GitHub has a published, non-draft, non-prerelease
`desktop_v<version>` release. A file on main or its frontmatter date is not
publication evidence. Local development can preview stable drafts.

## Stable version

Determine the next desktop version by inspecting `.github/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml` and running:

```bash
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml current
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next patch
```

Create the new markdown file in `packages/changelog/content` for that version.

When preparing a release, also follow the
[release surface review](../release-new-version/SKILL.md#release-surface-review).
Check the product changes for CLI, local and hosted MCP, API, agent-package, and
documentation updates before freezing the release candidate. Record any gaps
in the release task; a changelog alone does not establish release readiness.
Creating a changelog does not itself dispatch or publish a release.
Keep the notes prepared and merged before freezing the desktop candidate, but
verify that the public index and direct version URL exclude them until release.
For an authorized stable release, [Release Docs](../release-docs/SKILL.md) owns
website publication immediately after the app is published and verifies the full
version page and index. It reuses the post-publication Linux APT web deployment
when suitable or dispatches the missing website deployment within that release.
The user must not need to ask separately. This authoring skill alone still does
not authorize a release or deployment.

Each changelog file must start with frontmatter that includes both `date` and
`summary`:

```md
---
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
summary: "One concise, user-facing sentence for the changelog index preview."
---
```

Keep `summary` plain text. Do not use markdown or custom tags in it. The web
changelog index renders this field directly, so it should describe the release
at a glance without leaking implementation details.

Follow the writing rules in `packages/changelog/content/AGENTS.md`, including
[contributor credit](../../../packages/changelog/content/AGENTS.md#contributor-credit).

## Contributor credit

If a user-facing change came from a pull request by someone outside the
Fastrepl org, acknowledge them on that changelog item. Do not credit org
members, collaborators, owners, or bots.

Look up each merged PR in the version range and credit the author when
`author_association` is not `MEMBER`, `OWNER`, or `COLLABORATOR`, and the
user is not a bot. Put the thanks at the end of the item, after the
user-facing sentence, and link the GitHub username. Do not put credits in
`summary`.
