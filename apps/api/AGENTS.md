`/anarlog/ai` is the API runtime view. Its Nango entries should reference the
source secrets in `/anarlog/nango` rather than requiring API jobs to export a
second secret path.

## Service runtimes

`ANARLOG_SERVICE` selects the routes started by the shared API binary:

| Value | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| `all` (default) | Existing combined API, preserving current client URLs |
| `ai` | Transcription, LLM, research, diarization, and STT callbacks |
| `sync` | Sync, devices, attachments, sharing, hosted meeting API/MCP |
| `core` | Nango and integration APIs, account deletion, SCIM |
| `billing` | Trial/subscription API under the existing `/subscription`, `/rpc`, and `/billing` aliases |

The billing image uses the `billing-runtime` Docker target: one Machine runs
the Rust API and the existing `apps/stripe` webhook handler and seat worker.
Rust exposes `/webhook/stripe`, preserving signed bytes through a loopback hop
to port 8788. Only the billing role may enable `ANARLOG_BILLING_WEBHOOKS`.
Readiness at `/health/ready/billing-unified` requires the local webhook listener.
The deployment profile deliberately uses that path so pre-consolidation Rust-only
images cannot pass readiness during rollback. Retain a known combined billing
image for rollback after moving the Stripe destination. The Bun supervisor drains Rust
requests before stopping webhooks and awaiting claimed seat work.
Billing secrets include DATABASE_URL and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET from
`/anarlog/stripe-sync`; LOOPS_API_KEY comes from the API view LOOPS_KEY.
Optional SLACK_ALERT_ANARLOG_WEBHOOK_URL and SLACK_ALERT_CHAR_WEBHOOK_URL from the
same path announce new Stripe customers in each product's channel. Deploys only
import secrets and never unset them, so stop an alert by revoking its webhook in
the Fastrepl Alerts Slack app or with `flyctl secrets unset`.
Core retains the existing subscription configuration for account deletion and SCIM.

All roles require Supabase configuration. Only `ai` and `all` require
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `API_BASE_URL`; the sync runtime requires its shared-note
email configuration. Optional integration groups are validated only in their
owning roles. `ANARLOG_ATTACHMENT_BACKUP_GC_ENABLED` is accepted only by `core`
and `all`. Assign cleanup to one deployment during migration.

Role selection does not change Fly routing or provision applications. Keep
existing URLs working while clients and webhook providers migrate.

Standalone profiles are `fly.ai.toml` (`anarlog-inference`),
`fly.sync.toml` (`anarlog-sync`), `fly.core.toml` (`anarlog-core`), and
`fly.billing.toml` (`anarlog-billing-api`). The default `fly.toml` and
`fly.gateway.toml` route public and legacy custom domains through `anarlog-gateway`
to these services. Keep domain certificates and DNS routing on this shared gateway.
Core owns durable cleanup; other profiles disable it. Never transfer cleanup
ownership until the previous owner's worker has stopped.

`/health/ready/{service}` verifies the expected runtime role, configuration of
its primary subsystems, and that it is not draining. The combined role uses
`api`; Rust billing uses `billing-api`. These checks do not probe external
providers or prove request continuity. Keep dependency smoke tests and active
traffic deploy/rollback tests as separate rollout gates.

The drain deploy helper reconciles the supported single-process Fly profile
into each candidate. Unsupported settings fail before machine mutations;
extend its translation and tests before introducing additional Fly features.


The combined compatibility runtime can forward each role through
`ANARLOG_AI_ORIGIN`, `ANARLOG_SYNC_ORIGIN`, `ANARLOG_CORE_ORIGIN`, and
`ANARLOG_BILLING_ORIGIN`. Unset origins keep the existing local route behavior.
The proxy preserves uploads, response streams, and WebSocket upgrades; it does
not retry writes or follow redirects. Drain permits cover proxied requests and
upgraded connections through completion. Origins are rejected in standalone
roles to prevent routing cycles.

`api_cd.yaml` selects one explicit service per dispatch. `gateway` retains the
existing public URLs with its forwarding profile; deploy and verify all
standalone services before activating this profile. The default dispatch is
`gateway`. The optional `image` input accepts only an immutable API image digest.
Keep the image and configuration together in the rollout record. Explicit drain
adoption requires independent verification that the exact image handles SIGUSR1;
health alone does not establish that capability. Secrets are filtered by the
selected runtime before staging. Core's checked-in profile enables cleanup so
routine deployments preserve worker ownership.
