      "Notes live in local SQLite on the device. Cloud Sync encrypts content on the device before upload; Fastrepl only stores ciphertext plus operational metadata.",
    detail:
      "The desktop app stores notes, transcripts, and meeting metadata in a local SQLite database. Optional Cloud Sync encrypts that content on the device with keys derived from a recovery key that stays in the operating-system keychain and never reaches Fastrepl. Sync servers see encrypted records plus account and workspace identifiers, timestamps, sizes, and device names — not titles or note content. Data in transit uses HTTPS/TLS. Shared notes and Cloud API & Connectors are separate, opt-in paths that store a server-readable copy so a recipient or agent can open the note.",

    summary:
      "Canonical meeting data stays on employee devices. Fastrepl-operated cloud services run in the United States. A customer-hosted data plane is the path for a different region.",

      "Local notes never leave the device unless a user enables a cloud feature. Fastrepl-operated cloud — accounts, optional Cloud Sync ciphertext, shared notes, and hosted AI/transcription gateways — currently runs in the United States. Customer-hosted capture and a customer-controlled data plane are the way to keep meeting infrastructure in a region you choose. We do not offer a certified-cloud EU SKU today.",

      "Local notes, transcripts, and recordings stay on the device until the user removes them. Audio retention on the desktop is a user setting (don't save, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, or forever). Cloud Sync records, transcription results, shared notes, and Cloud API copies are deleted within 30 days of account deletion unless the law requires a longer hold. Audio uploaded for cloud transcription is deleted from our storage once the job completes. Cloud API copies are deleted when the feature is turned off. Shared notes remain available until sharing stops or the account is deleted.",

    detail:
      "Fastrepl does not use notes, transcripts, audio, or connected calendar data to train AI models, and we do not sell that data. If a team uses on-device transcription and a local language model, meeting content never leaves the device for AI. If they use Anarlog Cloud or a bring-your-own-key provider, the audio or text needed for that request goes to the selected provider under that provider's terms — review that provider's retention and training policy before sending sensitive meetings.",

      "The current processor list lives in the table below and in the privacy policy. Providers receive only what the enabled feature needs. Cloud Sync storage holds ciphertext. Speech-to-text and model providers receive content only when a user selects a hosted or bring-your-own-key route.

That is the product, not a setting. Customer-hosted Meet or Zoom workers, when used by an enterprise pilot, are a separate capture path and are disclosed as such — they are not the default desktop product.",
