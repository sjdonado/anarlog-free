    title: "Bot-free meeting capture",

  },
  {
    title: "Live transcription while you take notes",
    body: "A transcript is generated while you jot notes, on-device with a local model or through hosted transcription on Pro. You stay in the meeting instead of typing everything down, and the transcript fills in what you missed.",
  },
  {
    title: "AI summaries you control",
    body: "After the meeting, Anarlog combines your notes with the transcript into an editable summary. You pick the model: hosted AI on Pro, your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepgram, and others), or a local model through Ollama or LM Studio.",
  },
  {
    title: "Local-first storage",
    body: "Sessions, notes, and transcripts live in a SQLite database on your device, with recordings kept as local files. Export to Markdown and other formats whenever you want; there is no vendor-hosted workspace you have to leave.",

    title: "Search, chat, and agent access",

  {
    title: "No bot joins your meeting",
    body: "Granola, Fathom, Otter.ai, and Fireflies.ai either send a bot into the call or route audio through their servers. Anarlog listens locally, so the meeting looks exactly the same to everyone else in it.",
  },
  {
    title: "Your meeting data stays on your device",
    body: "Most notetakers store transcripts in a hosted workspace they control. Anarlog keeps the canonical record in local SQLite, and the optional Cloud Sync encrypts content on the device before upload, so sync servers only hold ciphertext. Shared notes and the Cloud API are separate opt-in paths that store a server-readable copy.",

    question: "Is Anarlog free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Free plan has no meeting or minute limits when you use on-device models or your own API keys. Pro ($15/month) adds hosted transcription and AI, Cloud Sync, and sharing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Anarlog join my meetings as a bot?",

      "No. Anarlog captures system audio and your microphone directly on your computer. Nothing is added to the call and no calendar access is required.",

  {
    question: "Where is my meeting data stored?",
    answer:
      "In a SQLite database on your device, with recordings as local files. If you enable Cloud Sync on Pro, content is encrypted on your device before upload and sync servers only store ciphertext. Shared notes and the Cloud API are opt-in and store a server-readable copy.",

    question: "Which AI models can I use?",
    answer:
      "Hosted models on Pro, your own API keys for providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Deepgram, or local models through Ollama or LM Studio. Fastrepl never trains models on your notes, transcripts, or audio; hosted and BYOK providers handle requests under their own terms.",

    question: "Is Anarlog open source?",

    question: "What is the relationship between Anarlog, Char, and Hyprnote?",

    question: "Which platforms are supported?",
